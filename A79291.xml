         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

It is not the cuſtom of them that are unaccoſtomed to Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:134616:23"/> not to betake themſelves to prayer, till worldly helps are out of joynt and cannot help them? Then when worldly means will not delp our decayed eſtate, the laſt refuge is to call on God. When the Apothecaries pots cannot draw them out of the bed of ſickneſs, (after all) prayer chuſes God for the Phyſition.<note place="margin">Mark 5.</note> When 12 years Phyſick will do no good, then the diſeaſed woman cares not to ask Chriſt his counſel. When death or the utmoſt end of any evil ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, then doth the worldly ſpirit turn to God, becauſe he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not work it out himſelf: an evil ordering, when God muſt be put in the ſecond and laſt place. Thus juſtly doth God ſuffer men to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe ſmall Croſſes, till they by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of prayer grow vehement and immenſe, like waters from the ankle to the chin. Well worth St. <hi>Auſtine,</hi> who,<note place="margin">In Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſ. lib. 9.</note> when his teeth did but ake, did flie unto prayer, and deſired them that were preſent with him to pray for him, and with him: whereas we
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:134616:24"/> only fooliſhly, ungodlily, do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the prayers of others, and fly to our own prayers, only when e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils are grown great and ripe. Be our evils never ſo ſmall, yet they may grow greater, unleſs we take prayer the remedy for preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Second error is of Godly men, who by the greatneſs of their ſins, or afflictions are kept and affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from prayer, as if it were only able to remove lighter burdens; nay rather, they ſhould be more diligent in prayer, by how much more vehement their anguiſh is.

                     <note place="margin">Rom. 3.10 Eccl 7.20</note>] Righteouſneſs is hard to finde. Are there ſome Righteous? is it not the voice of the Scripture, <hi>there is none righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, no not one:</hi> Not a Juſt man upon earth? True, when we name Righteouſneſs, we call to mind our loſt Pearl: God made man Righteous. This Apple of our eye was given away for an Apple of the Tree of Knowledge. If we ſpeak of men Righteous and Juſt, in reſpect of their deeds among men, we mean upright and honeſt dealing; if we ſpeak of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs in reſpect of God, then we mean no more a righteouſneſs of inherence, that is gone; but of adherence and cleaving to Chriſt by faith. Chriſts Righteouſneſs and merits are imputed to us. Juſt and righteous is that ſtile holy and good men are honoured withal in the Scriptures, denoting fruits of righteouſneſs in an upright life,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:134616:65"/> according to that,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 3.7. Mat. 1.19. Act. 10.22.</note>

To lay to heart, is a common phraſe in Scripture, and is expounded af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by the word <hi>conſider:</hi> It is uſed again verſe the eleventh, <hi>Thou haſt not remembred me, nor laid it to thy heart.</hi> It ſeems to imply three things.</p>

                  <p>Thirdly to be affected with it upon that conſideration, ſo as the heart joys in it, if it find it good; is greatly grieved, and ſorry for it, finding it evil: the affection of ſorrow ariſing in a matter deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, of joy in a thing comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.

                  <p>Thirdly, The Souls of the Saints in their deaths are gathered to the Lord, and (by the Lord) into bleſſedneſs.</p>

                  <p>Fifthly, The ſecure wicked world is little mov'd with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of the Godly. — <hi>None conſiders it, none lays it to heart.</hi> How eaſily theſe riſe, we need not fly to Reaſons to demonſtrate it: <hi>Righteous men are merciful men.</hi>

It is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of him, I mean the new na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that is ingrafted in Chriſt, to be like affected to the miſery of othors, as he has found Chriſt to him.

                  <p>There are no Graces poured by God into a good mans heart, as water into a Tub or Pond, which keeps all to it ſelf, and lets the ground be dry about it; but every gracious man is a Spring, a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that ſends forth ſtreams to water the eatth, and feeds the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulets that flow from it. When we once come to Chriſt the great Spring, he makes us little Springs to others:<note place="margin">Zac. 13.1. Joh. 4.14.</note>

                     <note place="margin">Hoſ. 6.6. Heb. 13.16.</note> This mercy is an holy affection of the heart ſympathizing with them

                  <p n="1">1. Mercy looks at them both, to the bodies ſickneſs, nakedneſs, poverty, beggery; there mercy will make a Chriſtian a <hi>Dorcas,</hi> to clothe, and relieve, to viſit and refreſh.</p>

                     <hi>Q.</hi> It may be asked, yea, but how ſhall we lay their deaths to hrart?</p>
                  <p>Anſwer, This way and by this means.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Prayer,</hi> beſeeching God and praying for theſe two things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That his taking of them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way be in mercy, and not in Judgment: It is in mercy always to them, but pray we that he do it in mercy to us alſo.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That he would raiſe up holy and righteous ones in their room, that there may never want ſome holy ones to ſtand in the Gap.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Repentance:</hi> ſo lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to heart, as that we ſeek out and repent of thoſe ſins of ours for which the Lord might take them away, and bring his wrath on us.</p>
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:134616:99"/>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Imitation:</hi> ſo think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the righteous gone from us, that we labour to tread in thoſe holy footſteps, and imitate thoſe Graces which were eminent in them, and left for our pattern. Thus though they be taken away for evil to come, yet by this, our laying it thus to Heart, the Lord will avert the evil from us.</p>

                  <p>When prophane and Godleſs wretches die, the wicked ſhould lay it to heart that live, leſt they die ſo, and (as the Rich man ſaid) come into the ſame place of torment. Alas, when they die all
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:134616:99"/> their good days are done; now they are taken away from evil, and vengeance to come, The God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhould lay it to heart alſo, and it ſhould cauſe them to depart from iniquity.<note place="margin">Pſal. 73.</note> This was the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets practiſe, and ought to be ours, to conſider the end of them, how God ſets them in ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery places, and at length they rumble and fall into the pit, and ſin and death puſh them down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to perdition.</p>
                  <p>Yea, but are we not to mourn for them as ſuch, by the loſs of whom the Church and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth have received ſome ſore ſtroke?</p>
                  <p>No ſuch matter, nay rather it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoves us to joy when theſe horns (that puſht at <hi>Juruſalem,</hi> and hurt Gods Children) are thus broken in pieces: It is for ſome good to come unto the Church that they are removed out of the way: yea, when God picks out prophane and wicked men (eſpecially great Branches) then may we have hope he is procuring ſame great
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:134616:100"/> bleſſings for his people. Take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the droſs from the ſilver and there ſhall come forth a Veſſel for the Finer; <hi>Take away the wicked from before the King, and his Throne ſhall be eſtabliſhed in righteouſneſs.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 25.4.5.</note> When the Godly are taken from among us, we loſe a precious li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor of ſoverain vertue for good to the Church: if wicked ones be taken from among us, let their ſinful aſſociates mourn for the loſs of one of their helliſh Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates and Companions.

                  <p>Our account muſt go like Gods account. The wicked are vile and baſe in their lives in his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem, but more vile in their deaths.</p>
